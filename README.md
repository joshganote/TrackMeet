# TrackMeet

## Description
Duration: 2 Weeks

If you have ever wanted to release a song you've written just know you'll need three things. You'll need a producer to take your demo and use recording software to make your song radio ready, a graphic artist to make the album art, and a photographer to take photos and promo videos. All three fo these will ensure that your next music project will be a success, and no momentum will be lost throughout the process. Finding these three highly skilled professionals can be difficult if you are new to Kansas City or don't know a friend of a friend. 

TrackMeet is here to help musicians connect with local producers, graphic designers, and photographers in Kansas City. The artist will be able to see a picture of the professional and a brief bio about what kind of music they make. The artist will also be able to visibly see where the professional is located throughout the city by viewing their location on Google Maps. Once you find someone you want to work with send them a message, meet up, and get to work!
